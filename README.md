***
Performed EDA on a dataset consisting of vaccination data on children inoculated with BCG, RG and DTP vaccine. Also trained a logistic regression and decision tree classifier model to predict whether a child is at risk of mortality post-inoculation or not.

The logistic regression model achieved a prediction accuracy of 98%, and the decision tree achieved a maximum accuracy of 100%.

The data can be found in the "Biostatem_OMS.xls" file, and the background information pertaining to the data can be found in "vaccination.pdf".
